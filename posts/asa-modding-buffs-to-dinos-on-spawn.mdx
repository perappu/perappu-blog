### Introduction

Kind of a weird choice for my first blog post, but I've been spending a lot of time trying to mod Ark Survival Ascended lately. The written documentation is exceptionally lacking, so I figured I'd try to pass on what I've learned. I'm by no means an expert, and I highly recommend reaching out to the Ark modding discord if you run into any issues.

Onwards!
