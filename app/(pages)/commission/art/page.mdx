### <div id="tos"><a target="_blank" href="#tos">Terms of Service</a></div>

**By purchasing my services you automatically agree to the following terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to be familiar with these terms. They are subject to change at any time.**

#### General

    * I reserve the right to deny service to anyone without explanation.
    * I reserve the right to use commissioned work for my portfolio (with exceptions -- see "Payment" section).
    * I will not use any PII (personal identifying information) for any use other than as required to provide the services requested.
    * In turn, you may not share my data for any reason.
    * The right to use my work is not an endorsement in any way.

#### Payment

    * An invoice will be delivered and payment expected upfront.
    * Payment may be done via Paypal (preferred) or Stripe.
    * Private/NDA commissions -- work that I can not post online or use for my portfolio -- will accrue an additional charge. Delayed posting (not posting until after a specified date) will not cost extra.
    * Rush commissions will accrue an additional charge relative to how quickly the commission must be completed.
    * Commercial usage will accrue an additional charge. This includes profiting off my work in any way -- merchandise, stream assets, etc. Failure to pay this charge and use my work anyway will result in blacklisting from future commissions.

### Stages & Revisions

    * You will be updated on each stage of the drawing -- sketch, lineart, and color.
    * Two rounds of revisions are allowed per each stage.
    * One major revision is allowed within the sketch phase. However, in the lineart and coloring stage, major revisions will accrue additional charge.
    * Revisions due to my own negligence are free.
    * It is up to my discretion as to what constitutes a major or minor revision.

### Copyright & usage

    * I retain the copyright to any commissioned works.
    * Unless otherwise agreed, I retain the right to post the commissioned work on my social media.
    * Unless otherwise agreed, I retain the right to stream, record, and upload videos of the creation process.
    * Any characters within my artwork remain copyrighted by their rightful owners.
    * You must credit/tag me when sharing or using my artwork. The username to credit is "stokori".

#### Expectations of Me & You

    * I will provide a fair and reasonable timeline for when your work will be completed, and I will provide an advance warning if the expected timeframe changes.
    * I check my work messages between 4 and 5 PM CST on weekdays, and sporadically on Saturday (typically early in the morning). I typically don't work on Sundays. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible, but I work 40 hour full-time day job so responses may be delayed. Expect me to get back to you within 1-2 days, excluding vacations or other time off. Please be reasonable -- this is my side job, and I support a family.
    * I reserve the right to deny services at any time. You will be refunded for any work not performed.
