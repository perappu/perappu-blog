## Lorekeeper Commissions

Thank you for considering me for your developer work! ❤️ I'd love to work with you. Read below for more information!
        <hr class="h-px my-8 bg-gray-200 border-0 dark:bg-gray-700" />

### <div id="hosting"><a target="_blank" href="#hosting">Hosting Services</a></div>

For people who prefer a more "hands-off approach" to Lorekeeper, I provide **managed hosting**. 

What does this mean? I can do *nearly everything* coding-wise for your site.

I can:
* Maintain all aspects of your hosting set up -- domain name, files, images, database, sendgrid...
* Keep your server secured
* Keep your site updated to the newest version of LK v3
* Install & edit extensions
* Turn mock-up website layouts into CSS/HTML
* Move your website to my managed hosting
* Provide general dev work for existing websites
* ...and more depending on your needs!

**If you're looking for a permanent coder to have on staff, then this what you're looking for!**

### <div id="newsite"><a target="_blank" href="#newsite">New Sites</a></div>

Initial dev work is **$40/hour**, which will be tracked via an external time-tracking tool. **Initial site setup is a minimum of $40.** Depending on your extension choices, most sites can be set up within 2-3 hours of billable time. Vanilla site setup (no extensions) takes about an hour of billable time.

I try to be extremely fair with what counts as billable time. I will send you messages periodically throughout the development process, so you are aware exactly when and what I'm working on! I can explain as much or as little of the process as you'd like.

**Hosting starts at $20/month.** This gets you this plan offered by DigitalOcean, comparable to Dreamhost's basic plan:

If you wish for a faster server, the cost per month will go up accordingly. You're free to pay for several months in advance.

**This is a better deal than DreamHost!** On top of hosting, the $20 per month includes:

* Basic maintenance
* Updates to LK
* Updates to extensions (within reason)
* Bug fixes (&quot;It suddenly broke and I don't know how to fix it&quot;) and other small changes (see TOS for details)

**Additional dev work after initial site setup is discounted for people I host at $35/hour.** This is as a thank you for choosing me for your hosting!

I currently do not provide site setup services for people looking to manage their own hosting (such as DreamHost). There's plenty of other coders out there that do, and I'd be happy to recommend some to you!

### <div id="existing"><a target="_blank" href="#existing">Existing Sites</a></div>
If you have an existing LK site and would like to transfer to my services, I'm happy to help! I charge $35/hour with a one hour minimum charge. Most site transitions can be done within 1-2 hours. You will need to be comfortable providing any necessary logins -- for Dreamhost, this is usually your account and PuTTy logins. After that, you still benefit from the discounted $35/hour rate.

### <div id="generalwork"><a target="_blank" href="#generalwork">General Work</a></div>
I can also help with general dev work at my standard $40/hour charge. This can include adding extensions, updating your site, etc.

Depending on your idea, I can help with creation of custom extensions/features. Let me know what your idea is and we'll go from there!

### <div id="tos"><a target="_blank" href="#tos">Terms of Service</a></div>

**By purchasing my services you automatically agree to the following terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to be familiar with these terms. They are subject to change at any time.**

#### General

    * I reserve the right to deny service to anyone without explanation.
    * I reserve the right to use commissioned work for my portfolio, unless requested otherwise.
    * I will not use any PII (personal identifying information) for any use other than as required to provide the services requested.
    * In turn, you may not share my data for any reason.
    * The right to use my work is not an endorsement in any way.

#### Payment

    * An invoice for hourly charges will be delivered after the work is completed. The site will be turned on and code delivered after that invoice has been paid.
    * I can work on a commission/per-project basis instead of hourly for general dev work, but please be aware that it will not provide a discount.
    * Payment may be done via Paypal or Stripe.

#### Hosting Details (only applies to people whose website I host)

    * Hosting payment has a 15 day grace period. If you do not pay before the 15th of the month, your site will be turned off until paid.
    * Hosting payment will be set up as a Paypal or Stripe subscription.
    * You may pay for multiple months in advance. However, I do not offer discounts at this time.
    * Bug fixes or changes that can be made in 10m or less (typically UI changes) are covered by your $20 monthly charge. To prevent overworking myself, frequent small changes will incur additional dev time at your discounted $35/hour rate. I'll let you know as soon as we approach that amount -- there will be no surprises.
    * Domain names will be purchased via Namecheap and managed on my own account for convenience. It's also a separate purchase from what I charge for dev work -- expect to pay $15-20/year. There is a legally required 60 day period before we can transfer the domain, but after that timeframe you may manage it yourself if you would prefer.
    * Your website's code will be available via a private GitHub repository at any time.
    * If you have another coder for your site, I have no problem working with them! I don't offer any discounts for that, however.
    * I typically do not provide email accounts (aside from admin@yourdomain.com, which is needed for sending registration emails), but this can be discussed depending on your needs. I'm happy to help you set something up.
    * If you wish to shut down, I will store your database for six months. We can discuss your options if you need it stored longer. Your code will be available on GitHub indefinitely, unless you request otherwise. Data can be deleted at your request at any time, in compliance with EU law.
    * Your website will be stored on a DigitalOcean suite of services that is managed by me. DigitalOcean is the one legally responsible for the storage of your data, not me.
    * If you decide to move off of my hosting services, I have no problem helping you migrate. I do not offer unpaid support after you migrate to a different host. However, you may hire me for additional dev services at my standard rate.

#### Expectations of Me & You

    * I will provide a fair and reasonable timeline for when your work will be completed, and I will provide an advance warning if the expected timeframe changes.
    * For up to a month, I will happily fix errors caused by my own code, free of charge. Errors caught after that time or errors unrelated to my code can be fixed as an additional charge.
    * I check my work messages between 4 and 5 PM CST on weekdays, and sporadically on Saturday (typically early in the morning). I typically don't work on Sundays. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible, but I work 40 hour full-time day job so responses may be delayed. Expect me to get back to you within 1-2 days, excluding vacations or other time off. Please be reasonable -- this is my side job, and I support a family.
    * Due to my schedule, "working" hour availability (the billable time that I am actively working on your site) may be sporadic. You don't need to be available exactly at the same time I'm working -- however, you must be comfortable with me messaging you status updates regardless of whether or not you are available at that very moment.
    * I can not provide assistance with community issues.
    * I reserve the right to deny services at any time. You will be refunded for any work not performed.

### Any questions? Feel free to ask!
I try to be as transparent as possible and I'm happy to elaborate on anything if desired. I look forward to working with you!
